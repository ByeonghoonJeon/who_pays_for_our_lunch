# who_pays_for_our_lunch
Randomization program with javascript.
It determines who to pay for the bill.

# How it works?
This code measures the length of array, the prepared name array, and multiply it with generated random number so that we can have a range of number betwwen 0 and length of array.
And then removes decimal numbers. When decimal numbers are removed, each natural number represents a name in the array. As a result, generated random number, without decimal point, works as a index of array. It is how specify someone to pay for the bill.
